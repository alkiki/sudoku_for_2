# Sudoku for 2 players 
*Rules*
The idea behind the game was to create a sudoku grid that 2 players can solve at the same time. The rules are pretty simple: before the game starts, players can choose the level of the initial sudoku grid. When the game starts, each player has a 1-minute limit to fill in the grid. If the value is correct, then it stays on the grid and the score of the players goes high by 1. If the value is incorrect, the grid does not change, and the playerâ€™s score goes down. The game ends when the grid is completed. The player that has the highest score, wins.
